# Similar Topic Suggester
A similar topic suggester program I implemented at JotForm for their forum.

Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning tools are used to implement to project.
A large dataset is used for training and testing the model.

In order to use it, create the corpus using the dataset. Then create and train the model.
After that, suggester.py can be used to getting topics similar to user's input.
